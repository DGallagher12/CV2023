      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        With over 9 years of experience in customer support for a leading tech
        company, I have honed my skills in problem-solving, effective
        communication, and providing unmatched service. Recently, I embarked on
        a journey into the realm of full-stack web development and successfully
        completed an intensive course, gaining proficiency in Java, JavaScript,
        React, Ruby on Rails, SQL, and other cutting-edge technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of my professional life, I am an avid reader, a tech enthusiast,
        and always keen on exploring the latest innovations in the web
        development world.
